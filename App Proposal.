AquaTrack
Water Policy Tracker
By: Lawrence Heras

Goal:
  My goal for this app is to develop a Mobile or Web-Based application that monitors water consumption, water availability,
  water condition and water resource policies such as SDG 6 or the Clean Water Act of the Philippines (RA 9275, 2004). That may promote sustainable water management.
  Not just water conditions, this project aims to support SDG 13 to combat climate change and its impacts.

Role:
  I am a software developer trying to contribute to the SDG agenda.

Audience:
  Instructors
  Students
  Researchers
  General public

Situation:
  Water scarcity, lack of awareness contribute to unsustainable water consumption and water pollution. 
  The application addresses these issues by providing real-time policy updates,suggestions,Awareness, tracking water usage, and encouraging sustainable practices.
