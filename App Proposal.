AquaTrack
Water Policy Tracker
By: Lawrence Heras

Goal:
  My goal for this app is to develop a Mobile or Web-Based application that monitors water consumption, water availability,
  water condition and water resource policies such as SDG 6 or the Clean Water Act of the Philippines (RA 9275, 2004). That may promote sustainable water management.
  Not just water conditions this project aims to support SDG 13 to combat climate change and its impacts.
