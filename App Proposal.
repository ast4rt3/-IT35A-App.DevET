AquaTrack
Water Policy Tracker
By: Lawrence Heras

Goal:
  My goal for this app is to develop a Mobile or Web-Based application that monitors water consumption, water availability,
  water condition and water resource policies such as SDG 6 or the Clean Water Act of the Philippines (RA 9275, 2004). That may promote sustainable water management.
  Not just water conditions, this project aims to support SDG 13 to combat climate change and its impacts.

Role:
  I am a web developer trying to contribute to the SDG agenda.

Audience:
  Instructors
  Students
  Researchers
  General public

Situation:
  Water scarcity:
    -Over 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries, with climate change and population growth worsening the crisis. 
  lack of awareness contribute to unsustainable water consumption:
    -Citizens and even policymakers struggle to track updates, monitor enforcement, and measure their impact.
  water pollution: 
    -Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and improper sewage disposal contaminate freshwater sources, reducing access to clean drinking water.

  The application addresses these issues by providing real-time policy updates,suggestions,Awareness, tracking water usage, and encouraging sustainable practices.
